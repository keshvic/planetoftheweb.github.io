Travel Suggestions
When you get there, Drive towards [Venice Beach][1], or the [Santa Monica Pier][2]

Lots of really good shopping and sightseeing and it's a good break after the flight. You can rent a bike, Segway or walk up and down the beach.

Drive up the PCH (Pacific Coast Highway) for some amazing sights. You'll go past famous Beaches: Malibu, Topanga, Zuma, When you go past the state parks, you'll end up in Oxnard where you can join US 101. The hardest thing is to convince your GPS to take the scenic route, so I usually put in Venice Beach from the airport and then once I get past Santa Monica, I put in Oxnard.

Solvang is that [Dutch Village][3] I told you about. Great food and shopping.

Here's the beach in [Carpinteria][4]. Allegedly seals go there, although I have yet to see them. There is a nice walkway with Eucalyptus trees that smell awesome.

[Stearn's Wharf][5] is a really good place to go in Santa Barbara. A great beach with lots of shops and restaurants. There's usually different events doing on.

If you're bringing family or if you want a more homey hotel. Check out the [Residence Inn by Marriott][6]. Really big rooms that are more like apartments with your own kitchen, couch inside a golf course. Great free breakfast.


From Oxnard you can get a lot of tours to the [Channel Islands][7] from the [Channel Islands Harbor][8]. Lots of places to eat in the harbor and some shopping. There's whale watching, kayaking (although I don't think that's on right now) as well as just trips to hiking in the island.

[Siam Elephant][9] is the restaurant I told you about in Carpinteria.

# [Wood Ranch][10]
In Ventura and it's the best place to have Tri-tip. They have excellent steak and other barbecue as well.

# [Downtown Ventura][11]
A great place to shop and to go to restaurants. There's also a small movie theater there.

# [Camarillo Premium Outlets][12]
If you're into outlet stores. I always get my tennis shoes once a year from this place, but it's like three malls worth of outlet stores.
