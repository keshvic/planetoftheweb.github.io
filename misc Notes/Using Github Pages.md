# GitHub Pages
We have the ability to provide additional content using GitHub Pages, which allows the publishing on repository content to the web as separate URL. This means that we could publish documentation, supplementary written matter, demo sites, practice opportunities and other content using our GitHub account.

## Do we want to do this?

The consensus is that this would provide additional value to our users with a minimal amount of extra work that could be leveraged into enhancing the experience people have with our current courses.

## Approach

In order to do this, the following teams will take care of the tasks to be completed.

### Legal
**Members:** Kim Tran, Morten, Samara
Kim Tran, Morten and Samara will meet to discuss the potential requirements and approval from the Legal team in order to do this.

### Domains
**Members:** Walt, Samara
Walt will get with Samara to discuss how to approach procuring a domain for this project. The choices are:

1. Using the subdomains provided by GitHub
2. Using a new Custom Domain exclusively for GitHub Repos.
3. Using an existing domain as a sub-domain

The consensus is that using a new Custom domain is the best approach. Something like LiLpages.com. Samara and Walt will meet to discuss our options, come up with a domain we’d like to use, purchase the domain and apply it to our GitHub account.

Our documentation would move to this domain and we would make it available to our users. We would document the process for users adding the courses

### Technology
**Members:** Ray/Morten
Morten and Ray will figure out what we need to do to so that users can add disclaimers/legal docs necessary to make this happen. 

Potentially an iFrame or Web Component that is controllable by us and easy to update in a central location addressing the legal and technical needs and added as a JavaScript file.

### Workflow
Once it’s approved, Steve and Walt will work to document, train and releasing the information to both instructors and producers.
