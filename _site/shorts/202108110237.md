title: "Flowchart Designer 3"
summary: "I'd been looking for a great way to create flowcharts, and I came across Flowchart Designer 3, which was just what I needed for some simple charts. There's a free version with a$7.99 upgrade for some more shapes. It works just as you'd expect. The arrows automatically connect the nodes, which then move with as you adjust other notes, items auto align to a grid and it's easy to enter some labels. Plus it lets you save as a transparent PNG or PDF. I do wish it would let you save SVGs directly from the app though."
