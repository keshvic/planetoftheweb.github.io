## Eta Templater

[![Eta Templater](/images/shorts/2021-10-24_17-36-20_tn.png)](https://eta.js.org/)

I hadn't heard of this templating system, but it claims to be a successor to EJS, which I really loved before I got and Liquid into Eleventy.

Claims to be a faster, more configurable EJS alternative It also lists Deno support, more flexibility with delimiters, multi-line comments and other small improvements. I started using this because Obsidian's very awesome templater uses it, although I can't make anything more than simple templates in there..
