title: "Github CodeSpaces"
summary: "This had been a long time coming. Github is now available for Teams and Enterprise. The beta remains until they announce a personal option. They reduced the startup time to 10 seconds and Github itself is dogfooding how they build things. For them it went from 45 minds to the 10 seconds mentioned above."
