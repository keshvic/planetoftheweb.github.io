## 30 SECONDS OF KNOWLEDGE

[![30 SECONDS OF KNOWLEDGE](/images/shorts/2021-12-07_17-54-04.png)](https://30secondsofknowledge.com)

I'm a sucker for replacement content extensions when you open a new tab, so I was excited to try this one which adds random code snippets that can help you learn the language of your choice. It's very customizable with over 900 snippets.

I added this to my chrome based browserâ€¦I love to use Brave and turned off some of the less desirable languages like C++ and Ruby (who needs them).
