title: "Sublime Merge"
summary: "This is a new Git Client from the makers of my favorite previous editor...Sublime Text. It looks pretty amazing and like sublime it's super fast. So, it feels less like a GUI editor than the GitHub client. I think that if you're still a user of Sublime Text, then you'll probably love this editor."
