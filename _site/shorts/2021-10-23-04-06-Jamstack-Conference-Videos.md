summary: "I went to the very first JamStack Conference and it was mostly fun, ran into Chris Coyier and Web Bos so that's cool. Here's a playlist with the 2020 version. Put together by Netlify, looks like some great content, but I just can't find the time to watch that much online conference content."

I went to the very first JamStack Conference and it was mostly fun, ran into Chris Coyier and Web Bos so that's cool. Here's a playlist with the 2020 version. Put together by Netlify, looks like some great content, but I just can't find the time to watch that much online conference content.
