title: "Svelte Kit"
summary: "Svelte Kit is Svelte's answer to NextJS or other frameworks. This is I think where Svelte breaks down a bit. It's nowhere near as modern as Next and it's been truly under development for quite a while. I'm really hoping this improves with all 'Extra' time Rich has now."
