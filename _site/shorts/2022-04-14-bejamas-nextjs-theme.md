title: "Bejamas NextJS Theme"
summary: "This is a Next.js template with everything set up the way I would want to do a blog if I was starting today. Tailwind 3, MDX support...although mdx always seems a bit overkill for a blog. I hardly need to put react components inside a post. However, I feel like I'd like that option if available."
