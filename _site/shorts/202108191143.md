title: "Snipped VS Code Extension"
summary: "Snipped is a VS Code Extension that makes it easier for you to share your code snippets by letting you take screenshots directly from VSCode. There's a lot of options for sharing code, but for me, I'm usually sharing a web snippet or something I've written myself. This is just about the quickest way to do it."

You can either take a shot of the entire file, or make a selection first. To take the screenshot, you can just use the command palette. command shift P and type in snipped to take the screenshot.

It immediately shows up on a sidebar preview. There's a button to immediately post to twitter. You can copy to your clipboard or download as well. It'd be nice to have other social media options options there.
