summary: "This is a unique new framework that looks like something trying to be a lot like Tailwind CSS. It provides a way for you to create a website without using a stylesheet by exposing a series of commands through class attributes. You can adjust media queries and have 172 styles out of the box. You can add lots of effects. Looks real interesting."
