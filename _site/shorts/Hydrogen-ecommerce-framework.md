summary: "Who thinks you need to learn a new framework? Well, evidently shopify has something special just for you. Honestly, I hate learning new frameworks either, specially when as advertised it's an opinionated framework. That's usually the death knell to any product...except when I live all the decisions they make."

## Hydrogen E-commerce Framework

[![Hydrogen E-commerce Framework](/images/shorts/2021-11-10_00-17-02.png)](https://shopify.dev/api/hydrogen)

To begin with, it already uses liquid, a templating system that's pretty popular among [Eleventy users](https://www.11ty.dev/). However, hydrogen is based on React, adds a GraphQL API as well as a REST admin API. It makes it easy for the sites you build with it to be search engine friendly and uses Tailwind CSS by default.

I really didn't want to like this, but there it is, pretty much everything I want to use packaged into a nice framework that's just like every full stack developer bingo favorites.

Now, all I need is some products to sell besides my [t-shirt](https://cottonbureau.com/products/pow-shirt).
