summary: "Sites like CodePen and JSBin provide code sandboxes that allow people to try code out. Although this might be a little self serving, I like this code sandbox creator library. I've been using CodePen and CodeSwing in my demos, but I always feel like it's safer if I could have my own version."

## Sandpack

[![CodeSandbox](/images/shorts/2021-12-06_17-01-01.png)](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io)

Sites like CodePen and JSBin provide code sandboxes that allow people to try code out. Although this might be a little self serving, I like this code sandbox creator library. I've been using CodePen and CodeSwing in my demos, but I always feel like it's safer if I could have my own version.
