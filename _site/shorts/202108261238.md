title: "Github CLI 2.0 - Now with Extensions support"
summary: "There's a new version of the Github CLI and this one provides an extensible framework that allows other developers to contribute content to the platform. The CLI is interesting in that you can use it to do a lot of stuff directly in Github. I like using it for creating issues directly from within a project. I can't wait to see what developers do with this."
