title: "CodeSpaces with CodeSwing"
summary: "An extension to VS Code to let you create a practice environment for someone to have an interactive code tryout. This works fantastically well with CodeSpaces new option to start up an environment by switching the link to the repo's TLD from .com to .dev. It lets you go directly to something like a CodePen with all of the power of Git and VSCode. Clearly a superior experience."
