summary: "This is an annual event for JS developers who love pain (I mean a challenge). Try to make something cool in less than 1024 bytes (1k). It's like when someone asks me if I want to get up at 5am to go to the beach and see the sunrise (no thanks). I feel like I have enough of a hard time doing anything in infinite K."
