title: "Apply: Success Hasn't Spoiled Me...Yet!"
summary: "Years ago, I went to a pickup game at the Y. Which reminded me why I quit the basketball team in High School for a nerdier Computer Lab career. I couldn't shoot, dribble or run (although I'm not sure I could ever shoot). I got picked last."
