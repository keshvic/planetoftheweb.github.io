This is a really cool library that gives you almost every option for creating different kinds of carousels. They're a great way of fitting a lot of data in a small space.

I tend to use Bootstrap for a lot of my websites. But I've been wanting to use something that gives me more options. Bootstrap really doesn't do let me do things like having multiple items display thumbnails at the bottom of my slideshow.

This thing is touch enabled, has usability and accessibility features built in so you don't have to write that yourself. And it has all these different options for setup. It comes with pagination, vertical slides and really, just about any feature that I would want in a carousel. For installation, you can go with either downloading the files, or you can go with a CDN. You can also just run an NPM install command and install the library locally into your NPM project.

There's React, View and Valve versions. You can paste your own SVG code for your own arrows and easily modify what the library looks like. There's also a video extension that you can use to have a carousel full of videos, which is another thing that I wanted to do with my project.
