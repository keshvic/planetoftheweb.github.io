Astro has been getting more hype recently than any other framework. After spending some quality developer time with it, I can say that it absolutely deserves the hype.

It's a Meta Framework that lets you use components from just about any other framework including React, Vue or Svelte. You can even mix and match components from different frameworks.

It also has the best implementation of partial hydration which loads the javascript for components only when you need them.

But don't take my word for it. Let's build something with it, so you can see why when I rebuild my blog later this year, it's what I'll be using.
