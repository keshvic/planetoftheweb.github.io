Pico.css is a framework that gives you a great looking site with minimal or no classes. It's only 10k is shockingly easy to use. It feels like what writing HTML should be.

Let me show you an example. Let's take a look at the code for building a bootstrap navigation.

The approach is simple, use native HTML tags whenever possible, while encouraging attributes that modify the look of the tag.

There is a completely classless version of the framework or a version that has only 11 classes in the framework.

- container
- container-fluid
- grid
- secondary
- contrast
- headings
- outline
- close
- modal-is-open
- modal-is-opening
- modal-is-closing
