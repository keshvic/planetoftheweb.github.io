title: "Apply Newsletter: Make it Small"
summary: "I was recording a course last week when I ran into an unsurmountable problem. You know the type where you think: I have no idea why this isn't working or how to solve this. Being an experienced moron, I did what I always do. Sleep on it. Which doesn't exactly make the problem go away, but I know that at that point, what I really need is a break."
