I wanted to give you a sneak peek into something that I'm working on, and that's a project called JavaScript as a second language. In that course, I'm creating a series of videos and each video happens to be on a JavaScript topic and I'm showing you how they work by context, which is how I learned English as a second language. So I created this example to explain something called nulish coalescing operator. It's this operator right here. I'm using the technique here called the short circuit, which is pretty common, but you may have seen it with the or operator.

When JavaScript evaluates the statement. If the part of the left of the or is true, then it doesn't need to evaluate the second part. And that's because if either of these statements is true, then the whole thing is true. And as a matter of fact, JavaScript doesn't evaluate the right side of the equation. If the first part is true, there's no need to do that.

Now you can use the short circuit to create a default value, and that's exactly what I'm doing right here. This technique is fantastic, but the logical OR operator has a problem. It will execute the right hand side of the equation if the left hand side has any falsey value. So if Lama ID happens to be null or undefined, it would return a random image, which is what I want, except for when I want to initialize the Lamas right here, I want to pass the index of the first item, which would be this image right here.

The problem is that when I'm passing zero, it interprets that as a false value because when working with booleans zero means false and one means true. That's what the Nullish Coalescing operator is there to fix. If I change this back to question Mark question Mark, notice that it is showing me the plain Lama. It only changes when I hit the switch button right here. Now, if I had the logical or here as I did before, it would sometimes give me a random Lama.

It will always execute the right hand side of the operation, even if I use zero as the index for LlamaID, and that's what this whole series is about. It's showing you how these things work in a context of building something like an app. It also tries to be a lot of of fun, and that's why I'm using Llamas.
