I love anything that has markdown in it. It's made my live a lot easier. Every once in a while though, I find something that truly changes the way I work...for the better. Obsidian is a markdown tool like Rome Research or Notion that does a lot more than just take notes. I think this is the one I've been looking for.

Of course, I'll review the latest tools including some new additions to Bootstrap 5.1 and lots of other goodies. You'll be sorry if you miss another episode of the Toolbox, plus AMA (Ask me anything). It will be fun, specially if you ask me something I don't know.
