## Flowchart Designer 3

<small>(Mac/iPhone/iPad â€¢ Free/$7.99 Pro)</small>

I'd been looking for a great way to create flowcharts, and I came across [Flowchart Designer 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flowchart-designer-3/id1512570906#?platform=ipad), which was just what I needed for some simple charts. There's a free version with a $7.99 upgrade for some more shapes. It works just as you'd expect.

The arrows automatically connect the nodes, which then move with as you adjust other notes, items auto align to a grid and it's easy to enter some labels. Plus it lets you save as a transparent PNG or PDF. I do wish it would let you save SVGs directly from the app though.
