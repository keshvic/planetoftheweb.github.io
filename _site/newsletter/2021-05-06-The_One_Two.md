There's a fantastic movie called _The One_ with Jet Li, Delroy Lindo and Jason Statham. It's about alternate realities where an evil protagonist visits different universes to hunt and destroy different versions of himself to get stronger. The movie is so good that it really deserved a sequel...which of course would have to be named _The One Two_ and if they keep going the next sequel would be _The One Two Three_.

It's thoughts like this that makes my wife think I'm a nerd, but I can't help it. Well, this week, I felt like I got a one-two punch from a bad reaction to the Covid Vaccine which left me a lingering cough, which once again means I can't record any videos. That also reminds of one my bosses' favorite quotes from Mike Tyson.

> Everyone has a plan 'till they get punched in the mouth

My plan was to record a video each week. I've been building up my skills and equipment to a ridiculous level and am pretty ready to get going, but I keep getting punched in the face...this time by the vaccine reaction.

But you know what, it's ok to miss your goals sometimes. Because they're after all, just goals. They'll still be there when I get better and I'm honestly doing the extra videos for fun and to learn how adding a little live action can improve learning.

So if you're missing your goal, pick yourself back up and start again. That's my new plan.

## New React Course

Speaking of which, I have a new React Course that I'm really happy about. It's a rebuild of a course on building a simple interface. I remember annoyingly that React had just introduced Hooks when I did the last version as I was recording this. And now everyone things hooks is the greatest thing in the world.

I admit that I really enjoyed how you code with hooks, but not the hooks themselves. They are confusingly named, but the result is code that's more fun to write after you get over the annoyance of the new format and how it works.

This course is a great intro (if I do say so myself) and you can watch my other related course on [React with GraphQL](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-a-graphql-project-with-react-js/creating-the-pagination-interface). There courses are short project based courses that show you how to build simple things. I build them like that because that's who I love to learn.

As soon as I get better, expect another episode of The Launch with more details.

## The Bootstrap 5

Since I can't record anything, I did write a short article on my blog on an extremely simple, but cool Bootstrap 5 technique that lets a button trigger a checkbox. There's a lot of small goodies like that in the new Bootstrap that I think you'll love. I can't wait until that course come out.

![Bootstrap 5 Slides](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQE06_zoFcpxSg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1620317812051?e=1629936000&v=beta&t=hNjsNLrTKu7bMTvqrR3UOewDK75mk6W_zfEfXkg1uJ8)

By the way, the course uses the newest version of RayVeal.js, which features a new slicker sidebar that's way easier to read. That was ridiculously tough to build since I had to use Vite with Eleventy and they did NOT want to play along together.

![Sample Practice Codepen](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQH2ct6PX-ikAg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1620318159943?e=1629936000&v=beta&t=hBK8xdW1I5s4J8v8_r__kTxVckTbUWD1aPDt9Dhl-1k)

There are over 100 [practice CodePens](https://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/pen/rNjvEjO?editors=1000) in this course, so it's by far the biggest thing I've ever built. I've been doing these for a few of my newer courses and I think it really helps to be able to jump into sample code and have something you can copy and reuse.

## What's Next?

Next, I'll be moving onto a couple of Github courses, which I really love. I had to stop buying their clothing because I think people thought I was trying to get a job there. Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere, I enjoy helping people like you learn new things way too much.

See you next week!
