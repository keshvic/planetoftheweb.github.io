title: "The Course Hustle"
summary: "This week, still recuperating, I walk you in detail through what it took to put together my latest Bootstrap 5 Essential Training course. I talk about adding a 15% challenge of something new in every project...which sometimes balloons to like 40%, but once you're committed, you can't stop...won't stop."
